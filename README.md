# EE679
Projects related to Speech Processing

Hello all,
These are the projects I have done as a part of my curriculum at IIT Bombay for the course EE679 - Speech Processing.

Assigment 1A consists of generating vowels using source filter model, along with implementation of IIR
Assignment 1B consists of using the STFT method in order to observe the formant frequencies
Assignment 2 consists of using LPC method for analysis of speech signal, observing the formants. Also for pitch detection.
Project is based on classification of musical instruments from their sounds using KNN along with K means clustering, in addition to a more general neural network approach.
